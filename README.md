# 👋 Hey there, I’m Brian Roy Mathew

**UX Strategist | BrainRot Designer**  
I design experiences that *feel* right—then I break them down, case-study style, just to show you *why* they work.

Welcome to my digital sandbox where my mind thinks in pixels, and my strageties are more than just pretty. 
I’m not just pushing buttons—I’m understanding why people love clicking them.
