| **Social Layer** | Social Proof & FOMO | Peer stats, challenges, and shareability increases engagement |
| **Personalization** | Identity Validation | Feeds self-worth; adaptive UX feels ‘made for me’ |
| **Emotional Check-ins** | Self-Reflection | Emotional bonding through mood logs/journals builds loyalty |
| **Scarcity & FOMO** | Urgency & Loss Aversion | Time-limited events or unlockables trigger repeat usage |
